Latest update: 03 Feb 2017

The application of the project is a service where you submit your car position
transmitter ("black box") serial number into the service in order to participate
in testing the functioning of the black box and the related forthcoming
Internet-of-Things application: charging tolls based on where one's car has been.

The application template with the security flaws documented below is running at:
http://konekettu.fi:8081

The source code is freely available at:

Issue: Cross-Site scripting (XSS)
Steps to reproduce:
1. Navigate to http://konekettu.fi:8081
2. Enter username "</td><a href="192.168.100.3/kettu2.png>Click me!</a><td>" and serial number "12345"
3. Click "Submit"
4. Some older browsers will show a hyperlink to an image on the opening page.
Solution / Fix: Update your browser if the link to an image is shown.

Issue: Broken Authentication and Session Management
Steps to reproduce:
1. Navigate to http://konekettu.fi:8081
2. Enter username "new" and serial number "12345"
3. Click "Submit"
4. Observe the following page showing you logged in as "new"
5. Click "View participants"
6. Observe the following page showing you logged in as NULL.
Solution / Fix: Enable proper authentication e.g. through cookies and control
these in sec.project.controller.SignupController.java

Issue: Cross Site Request Forgery
Steps to diagnose:
1. Access source code of the application in e.g. NetBeans.
2. Navigate to sec.project.config.SecurityConfiguration.java and open the file in editor.
3. Observe all security settings disabled and application accepting all requests.
Solution / Fix: In sec.project.config.SecurityConfiguration.java in method configure(),
uncomment the line "//http.csrf.disable();" which will enable built-in Spring CSRF
protection. Rebuild and re-run the application.
Alternative solution / Fix: Develop the application to only accept POST requests in critical
phases (="business logic")

Issue: Sensitive Data Exposure
Steps to reproduce: TODO
1. Navigate to http://konekettu.fi:8081
2. Enter name "exposure" and serial number "12345"
3. On the opening page, click "View participants"
4. Observe all registered participants with their Black Box serial numbers being shown.
Solution / Fix: Prevent serial numbers of other users from being shown by,
(a) Not adding this information to the model in sec.project.controller.SignupController.java
(b) Editing /src/main/resources/templates/participants.html to not show this data

Issue: Missing Function Level Access Control
Steps to reproduce:
1. Navigate to http://konekettu.fi:8081
2. Enter name "function" and serial number "12345"
3. Click "Submit"
4. On the opening page click "Back to signup"
5. Enter name "function" and serial number "23456"
6. Click "Submit"
7. The error page opens, as the database cannot handle two users with the same name
Solution / Fix: In sec.project.controller.SignupController.java in method submitForm(),
add functionality to prevent two users with same name from logging in.
